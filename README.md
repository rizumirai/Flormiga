# Flormiga
Flormiga is a digital technology and music project which aims to promote a sensible relationship between children and nature through sonic-plants. This project is the subjects of the Master's Dissertation Music with Plants: Cultivating Bonds Between Grade-Schoolers and Nature through Sound Design and it is being developed in collaboration and with the support of the educational service of the Orquestra Jazz de Matosinhos. The project was presented at the 21st Conference Consciousness Reframed 2019 â€” Sentient States: Bio-mind and Techno-nature.
